# 🌟 SMXL – A New Programming Language / Markup Language

**Version 1.0**  

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-SMXL-blue) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Experimental-orange) ![Browsers](https://img.shields.io/badge/browser-Chrome%20%7C%20Firefox%20%7C%20Edge-lightgrey)

SMXL is an experimental markup language designed to simplify web page creation while introducing a new way of thinking about structure and layout.  
Think of it as **next-generation HTML**, with cleaner tags, nested “boxes,” and easy-to-read notes. ✨

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 **Simple, intuitive syntax:** `(note1)`, `(box)`, `(text)` instead of `h1`, `div`, `p`  
- 📦 **Nested boxes** for clear content hierarchy  
- 🌐 **SMXL → HTML conversion** works in modern browsers  
- 🛠️ Placeholder for **future SMXL-native editors**  
- 💡 Inspired by building a **new coding ecosystem**

---

## ⚡ Current Status

- ✅ SMXL parser converts `.smxl` files to HTML  
- ✅ Compatible with major browsers  
- ⚠️ Requires a runner or browser environment to render `.smxl`  
- ⚠️ VS Code and other editors do not natively recognize SMXL yet  

## 🖥️ How to Use (Today)

1. Create a `.smxl` file (example: `index.smxl`) using any text editor.  
2. Open the **provided runner script** in your browser to render SMXL.  
3. Enjoy your **structured SMXL page**!  

> **Example `index.smxl`:**
```smxl
(smxl version="1.0")
(top)
    (title)Hello SMXL(/title)
(/top)
(body)
    (note1)Welcome to SMXL!(/note1)
    (box)
        (note2)Nested Note(/note2)
        (text)This is some text inside a box(/text)
    (/box)
(/body)
(/smxl)

Future Vision

Build a custom coding editor that:

Recognizes SMXL syntax

Supports other languages like HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js

Works on phones, laptops, and desktops


Provide a complete ecosystem for SMXL coding and running

Make SMXL more than just a language—a new world for coding
